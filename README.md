### Testing
  This Program contains 3 different tests, including;
    Should have no price more than 10
    Should have no item with calories over 1000 except for Full Breakfast
    Should have all the waffle dishes stating you get two waffles
  I created a ruby file in a lib folder which contains the methods used to test.
  All the tests are in the spec folder which also has a spec_helper.rb file.
